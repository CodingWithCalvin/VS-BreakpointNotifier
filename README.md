# Breakpoint Notifier

A Visual Studio extension that monitors debugging events, and when a breakpoint is hit, raises a messagebox to the screen. This will (should) cause Visual Studio to pop to the front (perhaps taking over focus) if you were waiting for a breakpoint to get hit during a long running process and decided to bide your time by watching YouTube videos.
